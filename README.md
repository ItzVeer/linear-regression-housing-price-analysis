# Linear Regression Housing Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for performing linear regression analysis on housing data to predict housing prices based on various features. It includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, linear regression modeling, model evaluation.
## Introduction

This Python script performs a linear regression analysis on housing data to predict housing prices based on various features.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Reads housing data from a CSV file, checks for null values, and encodes categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Calculates and displays the correlation matrix between price and other features.
3. **Linear Regression Modeling**: Splits the data into training and testing sets, creates a linear regression model, trains it on the training data, and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
4. **Scaled Model Evaluation**: Builds a scaled linear regression model using scaled input features and target variable and evaluates its performance.
5. **Multiple Linear Regression & Model Evaluation**: Defines the target and input features, splits the data, trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.

## Results

The repository includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for each step, along with sample housing data.
